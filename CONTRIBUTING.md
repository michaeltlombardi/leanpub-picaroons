## Style Guide

<!-- Need to fill this out as we go -->

+ The language is American English
+ No passive voice
+ Use the oxford comma
+ Use [semantic linefeeds]--after each sentence, add a new line.
  Only two new lines in a row breaks a paragraph.
  Consider inserting a line break in long sentences with multiple clauses--
  after each comma or semi-colon is a good practice, but use your judgement.
  This makes reviewing editing changes clearer.
+ To *emphasize* text (italics), wrap in `*`.
+ To **strong emphasize** text, wrap in `**`.
+ All links must be hypertext `[words to display](https://website.com)` instead of bare URLs

## Editing

<!-- Add to this section as we go with tips/info to ease the editing process -->

+ [GitHub Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/reviewing-proposed-changes-in-a-pull-request)
+ When ready for a round of review to be incorporated, comment on the PR to that effect.
+ It may be easier to read the document by selecting "Rich Diff" mode instead of source diff;
  you can do so by selecting the document icon to the left of the "Viewed" checkbox for each file being reviewed.
  Note that you cannot comment or suggest changes in rich diff mode, unfortunately.
+ Work on a single file at a time during passes on first drafts or long chapters;
  GitHub's UI may slow down drastically with numerous comments -
  in this case, it might be useful to submit the current round of edits for incorporation.
+ Use Suggestions where possible to distinguish between _changes_ and comments.

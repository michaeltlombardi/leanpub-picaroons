## 2. Before the Petrified Sorcerer {#picaresque-2}

You’re chasing down the corrupt guard captain, the town council is paying good silver (500/1000) for him dead or alive.
He stands before a 7’ mage statue, bejeweled rapier drawn and cape tattered. The sun is setting as shadows lengthen.

He is (d6):

|   5    | Determined, reaching for a flask on his hip  |
|   6    | Pointing his sword, darkness seeping from it |

## 3. When the Gendarmes Laid Low {#picaresque-3}

You were found guilty on the word of a filthy rich merchant for crimes you might have committed.
1d6 gendarmes step into the tavern as the world rumbles.
They glance at each other, lock eyes with you, and are crushed flat when the wall collapses.

The tavern patrons are (d6):

| Result | Mien                                              |

|   2    | Laughing and pointing at the hated gendarmes      |
|  3-4   | Startled from their places, looking at each other |
|   5    | Staring upwards at the creaking ceiling           |
|   6    | In motion, checking on each other calmly          |

## 4. She Won’t Let You Sleep {#picaresque-4}

You offended her, somehow.
It’s been 1d6 days since you last slumbered, and 1d6 hours since the sun set.
You’ve found her, singing lullabies to herself in her cottage deep in the woods.
At last, perhaps, you can lift this damned curse.

She is (d6):

|   2    | Reading an ancient tome by candlelight            |
|  3-4   | Playing an incomprehensible board game, alone     |
|   5    | Arranging flowers into a writhing wreathe         |

## 5. The Old Man and The Bath {#picaresque-5}

An ancient man seeks to bathe in healing waters long rumored and never seen.
He promised you enormous wealth (600s up front, 1800s on return) to keep him safe while on his quest.
Two months of travel and hardship and you’ve found them, at last.
The man slips, fully clothed, into a pool of dark bubbling water and then he (1d6):

| Result | Consequence                                       |

|   2    | Melts, screaming and flailing, after mere seconds |
|  3-4   | Arises, strong and proud, frenetic and glowing    |
|   5    | Blinks, confused, as apparently nothing happens   |
|   6    | Transforms, a lion’s head erupting from his skull |

## 6. In Search of the Silver Lily {#picaresque-6}

A young woman with bulging eyes was calling out for help.
She promised you her weight in silver for the petals of a magic flower if you’d just retrieve it from a cave known as The Mudfish’s Maw.
She handed you a map and now, two weeks later, you can see the cave, but also a tiger stalking a hat-wearing frog, who is (d6):

| Result | Mien                                               |

|   2    | Hopping up and down, dancing and splashing         |
|  3-4   | Ribbiting away, the tune jaunty and hopeful        |
|   5    | Fiddling with their hat, adjusting the way it sits |
|   6    | Chewing, talking to itself with a full mouth       |

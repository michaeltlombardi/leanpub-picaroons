# Playing Picaroons

You are a picaroon and start play at HD1.Roll a d6 now to determine your current HP.

You start **6-HP** domains, each starting at d6.
Domains are free-form; skills, knowledges, backgrounds, special items, whatever.
Domains can have any number of trick slots and all start with one;
each trick is usable once per scene.
You don't need to now, but you can fill trick slots with spells, awe-inspiring feats, or supernatural abilities related to the domain.
Tricks start at d6.

Picaroons start out broke.
You can take on debt to a patron, faction, or institution in increments of 2d6.
The lower result die  is the number of domains you get from your guarantor, the higher is how many d6x100 silver of debt you need to clear.
Picaroons can *always* seek more debt.

When an outcome is uncertain, roll d6; on 5+ (unless otherwise stated), succeed.
When an outcome is contested, all sides roll d6; results favor higher rolls.
If any domains are applicable to the uncertain or contested action, roll the highest applicable domain die and take the best result.

Any time a die rolls its max result (6 on d6, 8 on d8), mark it.
When you have marked a die as many times as the max, you can clear the marks to increase it by one step (d6 > d8).

# Resting

Whenever you have time and space to relax in relative safely for at least a week, roll your HD.
If higher than your current HP, that's your new total.

You can also fill/swap out any of your tricks or clear marks while resting.

In addition to increasing a die size, you can clear marks to:

| Dice Type |     Marks to Clear      | Effect                     |
| :-------: | :---------------------: | :------------------------- |
|    HD     |      Domain Count       | Gain a new domain          |
|    HD     | 3x Companion Slot Count | Gain a companion slot      |
|    HD     |      Combined Max       | Add another die            |
|  Domain   |   3x Trick Slot Count   | Gain a trick slot          |
|   Trick   |      Combined Max       | Add another die            |
|   Trick   |  3x Current Use Count   | Gain another use per scene |

# Tricks

Tricks can be anything you like, but here's a few examples.

* **Burning Blade:** Roll the trick dice whenever you please;
  add result to your damage for the rest of the scene
* **Call Lightning:** While outside, pick a point you can see and roll the trick dice;
  deal this much damage to everything nearby
* **Castigate:** Roll the trick dice when rebuking someone;
  Any attempts to interact with you for the rest of the scene require a roll to beat your result
* **Darken Sky:** Roll the trick dice while attacking at range; add to total
* **Disappear:** Roll the trick dice whenever you please;
  for the rest of the scene, anyone trying to spot you needs to beat your result on their roll
* **Encyclopedic:** Roll the trick dice whenever trying to recall information related to your domain;
  you know result facts about the topic
* **Fly:** Roll the trick dice whenever you please;
  move yourself and/or anything you choose freely through space for result turns;
  count an extra turn for each entity flown
* **Knit Flesh:** Roll the trick dice whenever you please; target regains that many HP
* **Rage:** Roll the trick dice whenever you please;
  add the result to any aggressive/physical action, subtract from any defensive/mental action for the rest of the scene

# Action and Combat

When in an action scene, participants declare up to two actions in order from lowest HD to highest.
Where there are ties, agree who goes first or roll off.
All actions are resolved simultaneously as makes sense.

Distances are tracked as zones: adjacent, nearby, distant, and far.
Participants can move anywhere nearby as an action or distant as two actions.

Attacks are always contested.
In melee, the highest result is the damage dealt to the participant with the lowest result.
At range, if the shooter's result is lower, they miss.

When you drop to 0HP, choose one immediately:

* **Carry On:** Transfer all of your current marks to a loved one.
  You have died, but live on in them.
* **Save Self:** make a test;
  if successful, return to 1HP but unable to participate for the rest of the scene.
* **Use It:** Sacrifice a HD to get back into it;
  reroll remaining HD to determine new your HP.
* **Wait it Out:** roll HD;
  unless someone renders first aid in that many rounds, you die

A friend can spend an action to provide first aid, testing as normal to bring you back to 1HP.
Alternatively, if rendering first aid after the combat scene ends, automatically succeed without a test.

# Companions and Hirelings

You can have as many companions as you have companion slots, if you can convince them to follow you.
Companions are picaroons in their own right.

Hirelings are temporary followers who expect to be remunerated at least weekly and daily if asked to face danger (costs in silver):

| Feature |               Cost               |
| :------ | :------------------------------: |
| HD      |     +1 per die and die step      |
| Domains |         +1 per die step          |
| Tricks  | +1 per die, die step & extra use |
